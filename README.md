### Design Patterns <br> 
#### 1. Factory Design Pattern: <br> 

`The factory design pattern is used when we have a superclass with multiple sub-classes and based on input, we need to return one of the sub-class. This pattern takes out the responsibility of the instantiation of a class from the client program to the factory class.` <br> 

#### 2. Strategy Design Pattern: <br> 

`TUse different variants of an algorithm within an object and be able to switch from one algorithm to another during runtime.` <br> 

#### 3. Command Design Pattern: <br> 

`Encapsulates commands (method calls) in objects allowing us to issue requests without knowing the requested operation or the requesting object.`

#### 4. Builder Design Pattern: <br> 

`The builder pattern is a design pattern designed to provide a flexible solution to various object creation problems in object-oriented programming. For eg creating a Student object with some members as required and some are optional.`

#### 5. Decorator Design Pattern: <br> 

`Add characteristics to an object at runtime. Many factors can affect the objectâ€™s characteristics.
